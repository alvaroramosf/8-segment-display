# 8 segment display
## Description
The goal of this project is to learn to produce a new hardware product since the beggining of the process (and to get back to life some forgotten soviet displays). I started contacting supliers in order to make a prototype of the display looking forward to produce a mass produced version of it in the future... Who knows?
## To do list
- Small "useful" gadget, like a 1 character banner.
- A custom PCB to test the display.
- A nicer example of the technology ~maybe a alarm clock~
